# Analyzing loan application records via the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau makes a TON of data available to the public. They're big datasets, but if you can scale down what you're most interested in, they're great to analyze. I tend to look at the data one state at a time.

In this repo, I include my Jupyter Notebooks with Python cleaning and the Tableau packaged workbooks I made. The dashboards are also viewable on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/natalie.sayth/viz/PennsylvaniaMortgages2018-2023/Presentation).
